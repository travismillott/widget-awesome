# widget-awesome

This is just a simple isomorphic react baseline project. Use it to speed up making a Redman react widget.

# Requirements

You will need the 'create-project' package.

    npm install -g create-project


# Setup

Create a new project locally

    create-project widget-awesome ryanramage/redman-example
    cd widget-awesome
    npm i
    npm run build
    npm start

All of the above should complete without error. Then you are ready to go! Visit:

    http://localhost:54833

# Development

When doing development, you want to watch and auto-build the less and js, just run

    npm run watch

The first build takes a few seconds, but everytime you change a file, it will rebuild really quick.
